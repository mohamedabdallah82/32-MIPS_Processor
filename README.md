# Single-Cycle Processor

This repository contains the VHDL code for a 32 bit MIPS single cycle processor. The processor is designed to execute instructions in a single clock cycle. It includes components such as the Instruction Memory, Data Memory, Control Unit, ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), and Registers.
## Overview

The Single-Cycle Processor is implemented in VHDL and simulated using tools like ModelSim. It provides support for basic arithmetic and logical operations, as well as memory access and control flow instructions.
